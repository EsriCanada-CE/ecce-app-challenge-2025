**Team Mission Statement**

The app seeks to enhance food security in Kitchener by providing essential information on accessible and affordable means of accessing fresh food, including community gardens and urban trees.

Our platform maps existing community gardens, offering residents easy access to fresh produce and shared green spaces. We also showcase Kitchener's urban tree inventory, highlighting fruit-bearing trees that contribute to local food sources. Additionally, we identify underutilized lots that can be transformed into productive, sustainable food sources. The public, urban planners, and organizations can utilize this information to improve local food systems and affordability.
