I graduated from Mount Royal University in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology, concentrating in Ecology and Evolution and minoring in Geography. Through my coursework, I discovered that GIS was a powerful tool in my problem-solving toolkit – particularly for its ability to creatively visualize large, complex datasets as simple, user-friendly applications. I am now studying at the Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS), pursuing a Graduate Certificate in GIS while honing my skills for my future career. My interests in GIS include conservation planning, GIS software development, natural resource management, and sustainable infrastructure. In my free time, I enjoy exploring nature, sim-racing, and sports.

Currently completing the GIS Grad Certificate from COGS, after obtaining my bachelor’s in Biology from Dalhousie. I have a passion for conservation and environmental applications of GIS. In my free time, I enjoy music, skating, hiking and travelling! 

## Audreana Rossi:

I am currently enrolled in the Graduate GIS Program at COGS, and a recent graduate from McMaster University with an Honours B. Sc. in Environmental Science and a concurrent certificate in GIS. After I graduate, I hope to contribute to solving GIS problems in creative and innovative ways. Outside of academics I enjoy running, paddleboarding at the beach, reading and attending any and all concerts.
