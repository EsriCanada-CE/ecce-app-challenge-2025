# VanMATCH Statement of Characteristics
To empower users to choose the metrics which are most important in their mission to select a neighbourhood to move into, VanMATCH presents an interactive view of sustainability and affordability metrics for 22 different neighbourhoods—defined as local planning areas—across the City of Vancouver.
VanMATCH is built around a simple Survey123, so users can rank what they prioritize in a neighbourhood. The 8 metrics available to rank in the survey are:
- Rental Quality/Safety
- EV Chargers
- Parks
- Community Gardens
- Community Farmers Markets
- Rental Affordability
- Bikeway Density
- Transit Stops

Survey123 was chosen for this functionality due to its simplicity and familiarity for users.
Once a ranking is selected for these metrics, the app generates a weighted neighbourhood score out of 100 upon selecting a polygon feature. This score is displayed in a table on the left side of the screen along with rankings out of ten for each of the top three metrics selected in the survey. This functionality is key to the user experience as it allows a high amount of customization, as well as instantly generated, clear results with just the selection of a feature.

Additionally, the app gives the option for an even simpler user experience using an explore map. When users click the ‘Explore’ button at any point, the need to submit a survey is removed and they can simply click through all the neighbourhood features to view the rank out of ten for all eight metrics on the left of the screen. 

The app is styled using an unweighted score, giving an overview of how neighbourhoods rank in all metrics at a glance. This styling remains the same between the ranked map based on the survey, and the explore map, maintaining cohesiveness between both maps available for users to view.

Lastly, with the aim of making a simple, but highly functional app it includes a few quality-of-life features in VanMATCH. One example of this is the address locator on the top right of the screen. This locator allows users to search an address in Vancouver, before zooming in on their selected location and allowing them to click the neighbourhood polygon the address is within to view its score and metrics. This functionality allows a user to easily enter an address from a rental listing, their current address, or even learn which areas they may want to check out while visiting the city. 

These features all contribute to VanMATCH’s simple, customizable interface, through which users can find communities that resonate with their lifestyles, values, and aspirations for the future.
