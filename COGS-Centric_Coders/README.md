## Submission for the 2025 ECCE App Challenge
### COGS-Centric Coders

## Mission Statement
This app has been designed for the Esri App Challenge 2025, with affordability and sustainability at its core, specifically catering to the Halifax region of Nova Scotia. Built using Esri’s Experience Builder, it integrates data from open sources such as Statistics Canada, Open Data Halifax, Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and Google Earth. The app provides an interactive experience where users can explore rental data for bachelor, 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, and 3-bedroom units, mapped at the census tract level as the base layer. Users can input their budget constraints and specify what percentage of their income they wish to allocate toward rent. Additional layers overlay this rental data, displaying key amenities like grocery stores, parks, recreational facilities, and EV charging stations. This enables users to make informed decisions about where to live based on both financial and lifestyle considerations.

We have created an app to help inform users with a desire to live in or around the city of Halifax. By combining data on rental prices with information on recreational facilities, EV charging stations, grocers, and local businesses, the Halifax Rental Explorer app paints a picture of the cost of living and amenities available at a census tract level.

### Team:
- Colin DeCoste: I graduated from the University of New Brunswick with a BSc. in Biology in 2017. After working in salmon and land conservation for a few years, I began to see how useful a tool GIS can be. That experience inspired me to seek a graduate certificate in Geographic Information Systems from COGS. If I’m not in front of my computer, you can find me rock climbing, reading, or cooking.

- Shreya Kapoor: I have a BSc in Environmental Science from McGill and a certification in Cartography and Applied Geography. Seeing the impact of data-driven decisions and the power of GIS led me to pursue a graduate certificate at NSCC (COGS), where I’m diving deeper into spatial analysis, automation, and geospatial technology. I love exploring different cultures through food, capturing moments through photography, and spending time with family whenever possible. 

- Grayson Tucker: I am a recent graduate of Trent University with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Environmental and Resource Science. It was through some of the courses in my undergrad that I found my passion for GIS. As a result of these experiences, I chose to pursue a graduate certificate in GIS at COGS. In my spare time, I’m either playing rugby or hiking.
