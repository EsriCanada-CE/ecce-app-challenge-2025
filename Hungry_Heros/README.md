## **Mission Statement**

The Harvest app seeks to enhance food security in Kitchener by providing essential information on accessible and affordable means of accessing fresh food including community gardens, foraging and urban trees. Our platform maps existing community gardens, offering residents easy access to fresh produce and shared green spaces. We also showcase Kitchener's urban tree inventory, highlighting fruit-bearing trees that contribute to local food sources. Additionally, we identify underutilized lots that can be transformed into productive, sustainable food sources. The public, urban planners and organizations can utilize this information to improve local food systems and affordability.

## **Growing Your Own Food**

With the rising cost of living, accessing affordable, fresh food is more crucial than ever. To that, we say, look no further than your own neighborhood!

Growing your own food is a powerful way to improve food security, reduce environmental impact, and reconnect with the land. Whether through urban fowl, or community gardens, urban agriculture can help individuals and communities gain better access to fresh, nutritious food.

## **Community Gardens**

**Benefits**

## **Urban Trees**

Urban trees are excellent sources of nutritious, fresh food with the local conditions supporting the growth of various fruits including hackberries and crabapples. Many urban trees owned by the City bear fruit and improve the micro-climate of the community.
