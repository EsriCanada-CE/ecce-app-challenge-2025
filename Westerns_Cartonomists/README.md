## Introduction: 
The cost of living acts as either an encouraging or deterring factor for individuals looking to settle in any area. The province of Alberta Canada in specific has been hailed as a leader in affordability throughout the country, with people moving from every province in order to stretch their money further. This dashboard aims to analyze data from the start of this trend in 2018, in order to paint a clearer picture of how and what accounts for the cost of living throughout Alberta in relation to the median income observed in each notable location. 

## Mission Statement: 
The goal of this project is to provide a visual representation of the cost of living compared to the median income throughout various locations in Alberta in a manner that is clear, accurate, and easy to interpret for individuals that do not have prior knowledge on the topic. The intention behind this is to convey the varying yearly costs of different necessities that an individual would purchase throughout the year, and compare it to the median income observed in the same location. This allows for a comprehensive overview of which areas are affordable and unaffordable within the province of Alberta. 

## Statement of Characteristics:
There are multiple features that make this app appealing to both a large and diverse user base. Firstly, the layout of the dashboard is configured to allow for users to toggle between each information tab, which serves to give a basic understanding of the analysis that was performed, as well as the reasoning for it. Second, the menu tab provides users with the ability to take a closer look at each location involved in the analysis, with corresponding pop-ups assigned to each area which showcases a comprehensive list of statistics relating to the affordability of each location. Rounding out the list of features are the two charts of standardized data located at the bottom of the dashboard. The data was standardized using Edmonton as the median, in order to establish a baseline from which other areas would be deemed affordable or unaffordable. The bar graph on the left is intended to illustrate the varying levels of affordability observed in each location when taking into consideration both median salary, as well as living expenses on a per-year basis. The second chart located on the right details the standardized cost of each major living expense, allowing for a clear picture of where the priorities of each area lie in regard to different living expenses. The aforementioned features combine to create a visual output that is easy to interpret, and takes into account a myriad of different factors that contribute to the cost of living, ensuring that each user leaves the dashboard thoroughly informed on the area of their choosing.
