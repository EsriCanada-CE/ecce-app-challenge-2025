Team Mission Statement - Housing Affordability & Carbon Footprint Map
 
Our mission is to create a data-driven mapping tool that seamlessly integrates housing affordability with carbon footprint insights. We aim to empower not only policymakers and urban planners but also the public - especially those looking to live more sustainably and within their means but unsure where to start. By analyzing average household income, average rent per neighborhood, and affordability thresholds alongside environmental and transportation data, our app provides actionable insights to:
       
    1) Illuminate challenges: Clearly identify how housing costs and carbon emissions interact, helping users understand local urban stress points.
   
    2) Drive Informed Decisions: Equip decision-makers with transparent, data-backed intelligence to foster equitable housing policies and promote sustainable transportation solutions.
       
    3) Empower the Public: Offer a user-friendly platform for community members who want to transition to a sustainable lifestyle, enabling them to discover affordable neighborhoods that align with their eco-conscious goals.
 
 
How the app was created
 
The web application was developed to assist both policymakers and the public in identifying affordable and sustainable living options within Toronto. The app integrates multiple datasets to provide a comprehensive view of housing affordability and environmental sustainability across the city.
 
The first map displays housing affordability, classified into four categories: Highly Affordable, Affordable, Marginally Affordable, and Unaffordable. This classification is based on an affordability ratio, which follows the principle that housing costs should not exceed 30% of household income. To determine this, the average household income and average rent prices per neighborhood was analyzed, and a rent threshold was calculated - representing the maximum amount a household can afford to pay for rent without exceeding this limit.
 
The second map visualizes carbon footprint data, primarily derived from location-based transportation data and existing automobile mode share. It highlights areas based on current transportation trends and access, helping users assess the environmental impact of transportation in different locations in Toronto.
 
The final composite map integrates both affordability and carbon footprint data, allowing users to apply filters based on their preferences. This interactive feature enables individuals to identify neighborhoods that align with their financial means while also supporting sustainable living. By enabling users to explore areas that balance affordability with lower carbon footprints, the application serves as a valuable tool for both city planners and residents seeking environmentally responsible housing options. 


How to get started: 

Click on the "Explore Affordable Housing" Widget to get an understanding of the affordability ratio. 

The map classifies neighborhoods into four categories: Highly Affordable, Affordable, Marginally Affordable, and Unaffordable, based on the relationship between average household income and rent thresholds. This visualization helps highlight areas where housing costs are within reasonable limits for residents, as well as locations where affordability is a concern.

Explore Low-Carbon Areas:

This carbon footprint map provides users with a clear visual representation of carbon footprint levels across the city. The legend on the right indicates that darker shades correspond to higher carbon footprints, while lighter shades represent lower carbon footprints. To enhance usability, the filter  widget enables users to customize the map based on their preferences, ensuring a more intuitive and tailored viewing experience.

Find your Ideal Neighborhood:

This map integrates data on both carbon footprint and affordability ratio, featuring interactive widgets that allow users to simultaneously select their preferred carbon footprint range and affordability ratio. A custom filter enables user input, providing the option to set specific criteria.
